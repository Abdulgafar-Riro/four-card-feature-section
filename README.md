## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS3** (SCSS for styling)  
- **Flexbox** for layout  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  
- Google Fonts (**Poppins**)  

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of **CSS Flexbox** and **responsive design**. I also learned how to structure **semantic HTML** for better accessibility.

#### Example of Flexbox for Responsive Layout:
```css
@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .cards-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    column-gap: 2rem;
  }
}

Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

Improve hover and focus states for better accessibility.

Experiment with CSS Grid instead of Flexbox for more complex layouts.
